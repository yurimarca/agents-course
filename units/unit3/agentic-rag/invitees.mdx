# Creating a RAG Tool for Guest Stories


Alfred, your trusted agent, is preparing for the most extravagant gala of the century. To ensure the event runs smoothly, Alfred needs quick access to up-to-date information about each guest. Let's help Alfred by creating a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool, powered by our custom dataset.

## Why RAG for a Gala?

Imagine Alfred mingling among the guests, needing to recall specific details about each person at a moment's notice. A traditional LLM might struggle with this task because:

1. The guest list is specific to your event and not in the model's training data
2. Guest information may change or be updated frequently
3. Alfred needs to retrieve precise details like email addresses

This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) shines! By combining a retrieval system with an LLM, Alfred can access accurate, up-to-date information about your guests on demand.

<Tip>

You can choose any of the frameworks covered in the course for this use case. Select your preferred option from the code tabs.

## Setting up our application

In this unit, we'll develop our agent within a HF Space, as a structured Python project. This approach helps us maintain clean, modular code by organizing different functionalities into separate files.  Also, this makes for a more realistic use case where you would deploy the application for public use.

### Project Structure

- **`tools.py`** – Provides auxiliary tools for the agent.  
- **`retriever.py`** – Implements retrieval functions to support knowledge access.  
- **`app.py`** – Integrates all components into a fully functional agent, which we'll finalize in the last part of this unit.  

For a hands-on reference, check out [this HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Unit_3_Agentic_RAG), where the Agentic RAG developed in this unit is live. Feel free to clone it and experiment!

You can directly test the agent below:

## Dataset Overview

Our dataset [`agents-course/unit3-invitees`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/unit3-invitees/) contains the following fields for each guest:

- **Name**: Guest's full name
- **Relation**: How the guest is related to the host
- **Description**: A brief biography or interesting facts about the guest
- **Email Address**: Contact information for sending invitations or follow-ups

Below is a preview of the dataset:

<Tip>
In a real-world scenario, this dataset could be expanded to include dietary preferences, gift interests, conversation topics to avoid, and other helpful details for a host.

## Building the Guestbook Tool

We'll create a custom tool that Alfred can use to quickly retrieve guest information during the gala. Let's break this down into three manageable steps:

1. Load and prepare the dataset
2. Create the Retriever Tool
3. Integrate the Tool with Alfred

Let's start with loading and preparing the dataset!

### Step 1: Load and Prepare the Dataset

First, we need to transform our raw guest data into a format that's optimized for retrieval.

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

We will use the Hugging Face `datasets` library to load the dataset and convert it into a list of `Document` objects from the `langchain.docstore.document` module.

```python
import datasets
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Load the dataset
guest_dataset = datasets.load_dataset("agents-course/unit3-invitees", split="train")

# Convert dataset entries into Document objects
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="\n".join([
            f"Name: {guest['name']}",
            f"Relation: {guest['relation']}",
            f"Description: {guest['description']}",
            f"Email: {guest['email']}"
        ]),
        metadata={"name": guest["name"]}
    )
    for guest in guest_dataset
]

```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="llama-index">

We will use the Hugging Face `datasets` library to load the dataset and convert it into a list of `Document` objects from the `llama_index.core.schema` module.

```python
import datasets
from llama_index.core.schema import Document

# Load the dataset
guest_dataset = datasets.load_dataset("agents-course/unit3-invitees", split="train")

# Convert dataset entries into Document objects
docs = [
    Document(
        text="\n".join([
            f"Name: {guest_dataset['name'][i]}",
            f"Relation: {guest_dataset['relation'][i]}",
            f"Description: {guest_dataset['description'][i]}",
            f"Email: {guest_dataset['email'][i]}"
        ]),
        metadata={"name": guest_dataset['name'][i]}
    )
    for i in range(len(guest_dataset))
]
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="langgraph">

We will use the Hugging Face `datasets` library to load the dataset and convert it into a list of `Document` objects from the `langchain.docstore.document` module.

```python
import datasets
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Load the dataset
guest_dataset = datasets.load_dataset("agents-course/unit3-invitees", split="train")

# Convert dataset entries into Document objects
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="\n".join([
            f"Name: {guest['name']}",
            f"Relation: {guest['relation']}",
            f"Description: {guest['description']}",
            f"Email: {guest['email']}"
        ]),
        metadata={"name": guest["name"]}
    )
    for guest in guest_dataset
]
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

In the code above, we:
- Load the dataset
- Convert each guest entry into a `Document` object with formatted content
- Store the `Document` objects in a list

This means we've got all of our data nicely available so we can get started with configuring our retrieval.

### Step 2: Create the Retriever Tool

Now, let's create a custom tool that Alfred can use to search through our guest information.

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

We will use the `BM25Retriever` from the `langchain_community.retrievers` module to create a retriever tool.

<Tip>
  The <code>BM25Retriever</code> is a great starting point for retrieval, but for more advanced semantic search, you might consider using embedding-based retrievers like those from <a href="https://www.sbert.net/">sentence-transformers</a>.
</Tip>

```python
from smolagents import Tool
from langchain_community.retrievers import BM25Retriever

class GuestInfoRetrieverTool(Tool):
    name = "guest_info_retriever"
    description = "Retrieves detailed information about gala guests based on their name or relation."
    inputs = {
        "query": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The name or relation of the guest you want information about."
        }
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def __init__(self, docs):
        self.is_initialized = False
        self.retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(docs)

    def forward(self, query: str):
        results = self.retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
        if results:
            return "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in results[:3]])
        else:
            return "No matching guest information found."

# Initialize the tool
guest_info_tool = GuestInfoRetrieverTool(docs)
```

Let's understand this tool step-by-step: 
- The `name` and `description` help the agent understand when and how to use this tool
- The `inputs` define what parameters the tool expects (in this case, a search query)
- We're using a `BM25Retriever`, which is a powerful text retrieval algorithm that doesn't require embeddings
- The `forward` method processes the query and returns the most relevant guest information

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="llama-index">

We will use the `BM25Retriever` from the `llama_index.retrievers.bm25` module to create a retriever tool.

<Tip>
  The <code>BM25Retriever</code> is a great starting point for retrieval, but for more advanced semantic search, you might consider using embedding-based retrievers like those from <a href="https://www.sbert.net/">sentence-transformers</a>.
</Tip>

```python
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool
from llama_index.retrievers.bm25 import BM25Retriever

bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_defaults(nodes=docs)

def get_guest_info_retriever(query: str) -> str:
    """Retrieves detailed information about gala guests based on their name or relation."""
    results = bm25_retriever.retrieve(query)
    if results:
        return "\n\n".join([doc.text for doc in results[:3]])
    else:
        return "No matching guest information found."

# Initialize the tool
guest_info_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(get_guest_info_retriever)
```

Let's understand this tool step-by-step. 
- The docstring helps the agent understand when and how to use this tool
- The type decorators define what parameters the tool expects (in this case, a search query)
- We're using a `BM25Retriever`, which is a powerful text retrieval algorithm that doesn't require embeddings
- The method processes the query and returns the most relevant guest information

def extract_text(query: str) -> str:

    results = bm25_retriever.invoke(query)
    if results:
        return "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in results[:3]])
    else:
        return "No matching guest information found."

guest_info_tool = Tool(
    name="guest_info_retriever",
    func=extract_text,
    description="Retrieves detailed information about gala guests based on their name or relation."
)
```

- The method processes the query and returns the most relevant guest information

### Step 3: Integrate the Tool with Alfred

Finally, let's bring everything together by creating our agent and equipping it with our custom tool:

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel

# Initialize the Hugging Face model
model = InferenceClientModel()

# Create Alfred, our gala agent, with the guest info tool
alfred = CodeAgent(tools=[guest_info_tool], model=model)

# Example query Alfred might receive during the gala
response = alfred.run("Tell me about our guest named 'Lady Ada Lovelace'.")

print("🎩 Alfred's Response:")
print(response)
```

Expected output:

```
🎩 Alfred's Response:
Based on the information I retrieved, Lady Ada Lovelace is an esteemed mathematician and friend. She is renowned for her pioneering work in mathematics and computing, often celebrated as the first computer programmer due to her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Her email address is ada.lovelace@example.com.
```

What's happening in this final step:
- We initialize a Hugging Face model using the `InferenceClientModel` class
- We create our agent (Alfred) as a `CodeAgent`, which can execute Python code to solve problems
- We ask Alfred to retrieve information about a guest named "Lady Ada Lovelace"

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="llama-index">

```python
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import AgentWorkflow
from llama_index.llms.huggingface_api import HuggingFaceInferenceAPI

# Initialize the Hugging Face model
llm = HuggingFaceInferenceAPI(model_name="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")

# Create Alfred, our gala agent, with the guest info tool
alfred = AgentWorkflow.from_tools_or_functions(
    [guest_info_tool],
    llm=llm,
)

# Example query Alfred might receive during the gala
response = await alfred.run("Tell me about our guest named 'Lady Ada Lovelace'.")

print("🎩 Alfred's Response:")
print(response)
```

Expected output:

```
🎩 Alfred's Response:
Lady Ada Lovelace is an esteemed mathematician and friend, renowned for her pioneering work in mathematics and computing. She is celebrated as the first computer programmer due to her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Her email is ada.lovelace@example.com.
```

What's happening in this final step:
- We initialize a Hugging Face model using the `HuggingFaceInferenceAPI` class
- We create our agent (Alfred) as a `AgentWorkflow`, including the tool we just created
- We ask Alfred to retrieve information about a guest named "Lady Ada Lovelace"

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="langgraph">

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint, ChatHuggingFace

# Generate the chat interface, including the tools
llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(
    repo_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct",
    huggingfacehub_api_token=HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN,
)

chat = ChatHuggingFace(llm=llm, verbose=True)
tools = [guest_info_tool]
chat_with_tools = chat.bind_tools(tools)

# Generate the AgentState and Agent graph
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]

def assistant(state: AgentState):
    return {
        "messages": [chat_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])],
    }

## The graph
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Define nodes: these do the work
builder.add_node("assistant", assistant)
builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))

# Define edges: these determine how the control flow moves
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    # If the latest message requires a tool, route to tools
    # Otherwise, provide a direct response
    tools_condition,
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")
alfred = builder.compile()

messages = [HumanMessage(content="Tell me about our guest named 'Lady Ada Lovelace'.")]
response = alfred.invoke({"messages": messages})

print("🎩 Alfred's Response:")
print(response['messages'][-1].content)
```

Expected output:

```
🎩 Alfred's Response:
Lady Ada Lovelace is an esteemed mathematician and pioneer in computing, often celebrated as the first computer programmer due to her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.
```

What's happening in this final step:
- We initialize a Hugging Face model using the `HuggingFaceEndpoint` class. We also generate a chat interface and append the tools.
- We create our agent (Alfred) as a `StateGraph`, that combines 2 nodes (`assistant`, `tools`) using an edge
- We ask Alfred to retrieve information about a guest named "Lady Ada Lovelace"

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

## Example Interaction

During the gala, a conversation might flow like this:

**You:** "Alfred, who is that gentleman talking to the ambassador?"

**Alfred:** *quickly searches the guest database* "That's Dr. Nikola Tesla, sir. He's an old friend from your university days. He's recently patented a new wireless energy transmission system and would be delighted to discuss it with you. Just remember he's passionate about pigeons, so that might make for good small talk."

```json
{
    "name": "Dr. Nikola Tesla",
    "relation": "old friend from university days",  
    "description": "Dr. Nikola Tesla is an old friend from your university days. He's recently patented a new wireless energy transmission system and would be delighted to discuss it with you. Just remember he's passionate about pigeons, so that might make for good small talk.",
    "email": "nikola.tesla@gmail.com"
}
```

## Taking It Further

Now that Alfred can retrieve guest information, consider how you might enhance this system:

1. **Improve the retriever** to use a more sophisticated algorithm like [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)
2. **Implement a conversation memory** so Alfred remembers previous interactions
3. **Combine with web search** to get the latest information on unfamiliar guests
4. **Integrate multiple indexes** to get more complete information from verified sources

Now Alfred is fully equipped to handle guest inquiries effortlessly, ensuring your gala is remembered as the most sophisticated and delightful event of the century!

<Tip>
Try extending the retriever tool to also return conversation starters based on each guest's interests or background. How would you modify the tool to accomplish this?

When you're done, implement your guest retriever tool in the <code>retriever.py</code> file.
