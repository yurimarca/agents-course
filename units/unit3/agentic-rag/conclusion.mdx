# Conclusion

In this unit, we've learned how to create an agentic RAG system to help Alfred, our friendly neighborhood agent, prepare for and manage an extravagant gala.

The combination of RAG with agentic capabilities demonstrates how powerful AI assistants can become when they have:
- Access to structured knowledge (guest information)
- Ability to retrieve real-time information (web search)
- Domain-specific tools (weather information, Hub stats)
- Memory of past interactions

With these capabilities, Alfred is now well-equipped to be the perfect host, able to answer questions about guests, provide up-to-date information, and ensure the gala runs smoothlyâ€”even managing the perfect timing for the fireworks display!

<Tip>
Now that you've built a complete agent, you might want to explore:

- Creating more specialized tools for your own use cases
- Implementing more sophisticated RAG systems with embeddings
- Building multi-agent systems where agents can collaborate
- Deploying your agent as a service that others can interact with
