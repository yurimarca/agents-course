# Creating Your Gala Agent

Now that we've built all the necessary components for Alfred, it's time to bring everything together into a complete agent that can help host our extravagant gala. 

In this section, we'll combine the guest information retrieval, web search, weather information, and Hub stats tools into a single powerful agent.

## Assembling Alfred: The Complete Agent

Instead of reimplementing all the tools we've created in previous sections, we'll import them from their respective modules which we saved in the `tools.py` and `retriever.py` files.

<Tip>
If you haven't implemented the tools yet, go back to the <a href="./tools">tools</a> and <a href="./invitees">retriever</a> sections to implement them, and add them to the <code>tools.py</code> and <code>retriever.py</code> files.
</Tip>

Let's import the necessary libraries and tools from the previous sections:

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import random
from smolagents import CodeAgent, InferenceClientModel

# Import our custom tools from their modules
from tools import DuckDuckGoSearchTool, WeatherInfoTool, HubStatsTool
from retriever import load_guest_dataset
```

Now, let's combine all these tools into a single agent:

```python
# Initialize the Hugging Face model
model = InferenceClientModel()

# Initialize the web search tool
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()

# Initialize the weather tool
weather_info_tool = WeatherInfoTool()

# Initialize the Hub stats tool
hub_stats_tool = HubStatsTool()

# Load the guest dataset and initialize the guest info tool
guest_info_tool = load_guest_dataset()

# Create Alfred with all the tools
alfred = CodeAgent(
    tools=[guest_info_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool, search_tool], 
    model=model,
    add_base_tools=True,  # Add any additional base tools
    planning_interval=3   # Enable planning every 3 steps
)
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="llama-index">

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import AgentWorkflow
from llama_index.llms.huggingface_api import HuggingFaceInferenceAPI

from tools import search_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool
from retriever import guest_info_tool
```

Now, let's combine all these tools into a single agent:

```python
# Initialize the Hugging Face model
llm = HuggingFaceInferenceAPI(model_name="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")

# Create Alfred with all the tools
alfred = AgentWorkflow.from_tools_or_functions(
    [guest_info_tool, search_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool],
    llm=llm,
)
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="langgraph">

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import tools_condition
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint, ChatHuggingFace

from tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool
from retriever import guest_info_tool
```

Now, let’s combine all these tools into a single agent:

```python
# Initialize the web search tool
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

# Generate the chat interface, including the tools
llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(
    repo_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct",
    huggingfacehub_api_token=HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN,
)

chat = ChatHuggingFace(llm=llm, verbose=True)
tools = [guest_info_tool, search_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool]
chat_with_tools = chat.bind_tools(tools)

# Generate the AgentState and Agent graph
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]

def assistant(state: AgentState):
    return {
        "messages": [chat_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])],
    }

## The graph
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Define nodes: these do the work
builder.add_node("assistant", assistant)
builder.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))

# Define edges: these determine how the control flow moves
builder.add_edge(START, "assistant")
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "assistant",
    # If the latest message requires a tool, route to tools
    # Otherwise, provide a direct response
    tools_condition,
)
builder.add_edge("tools", "assistant")
alfred = builder.compile()
```
</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

Your agent is now ready to use!

## Advanced Features: Conversation Memory

To make Alfred even more helpful during the gala, we can enable conversation memory so he remembers previous interactions:

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

```python
# Create Alfred with conversation memory
alfred_with_memory = CodeAgent(
    tools=[guest_info_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool, search_tool], 
    model=model,
    add_base_tools=True,
    planning_interval=3
)

# First interaction
response1 = alfred_with_memory.run("Tell me about Lady Ada Lovelace.")
print("🎩 Alfred's First Response:")
print(response1)

# Second interaction (referencing the first)
response2 = alfred_with_memory.run("What projects is she currently working on?", reset=False)
print("🎩 Alfred's Second Response:")
print(response2)
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="llama-index">

```python
from llama_index.core.workflow import Context

alfred = AgentWorkflow.from_tools_or_functions(
    [guest_info_tool, search_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool],
    llm=llm
)

# Remembering state
ctx = Context(alfred)

# First interaction
response1 = await alfred.run("Tell me about Lady Ada Lovelace.", ctx=ctx)
print("🎩 Alfred's First Response:")
print(response1)

# Second interaction (referencing the first)
response2 = await alfred.run("What projects is she currently working on?", ctx=ctx)
print("🎩 Alfred's Second Response:")
print(response2)
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="langgraph">

```python
# First interaction
response = alfred.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Tell me about 'Lady Ada Lovelace'. What's her background and how is she related to me?")]})


print("🎩 Alfred's Response:")
print(response['messages'][-1].content)
print()

# Second interaction (referencing the first)
response = alfred.invoke({"messages": response["messages"] + [HumanMessage(content="What projects is she currently working on?")]})

print("🎩 Alfred's Response:")
print(response['messages'][-1].content)
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

Notice that none of these three agent approaches directly couple memory with the agent. Is there a specific reason for this design choice 🧐?
* smolagents: Memory is not preserved across different execution runs, you must explicitly state it using `reset=False`.
* LlamaIndex: Requires explicitly adding a context object for memory management within a run.
* LangGraph: Offers options to retrieve previous messages or utilize a dedicated [MemorySaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/#part-3-adding-memory-to-the-chatbot) component.
