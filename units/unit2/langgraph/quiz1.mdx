# Test Your Understanding of LangGraph

Let's test your understanding of `LangGraph` with a quick quiz! This will help reinforce the key concepts we've covered so far.

This is an optional quiz and it's not graded.

### Q1: What is the primary purpose of LangGraph?
Which statement best describes what LangGraph is designed for?

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "A framework to build control flows for applications containing LLMs",
    explain: "LangGraph is specifically designed to help build and manage the control flow of applications that use LLMs.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "A library that provides interfaces to interact with different LLM models",
    explain: "This better describes LangChain's role, which provides standard interfaces for model interaction. LangGraph focuses on control flow.",
  },
  {
    text: "An Agent library for tool calling",
    explain: "While LangGraph works with agents, the main purpose of langGraph is 'Ochestration'.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q2: In the context of the "Control vs Freedom" trade-off, where does LangGraph stand?
Which statement best characterizes LangGraph's approach to agent design?

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "LangGraph maximizes freedom, allowing LLMs to make all decisions independently",
    explain: "LangGraph actually focuses more on control than freedom, providing structure for LLM workflows.",
  },
  {
    text: "LangGraph provides strong control over execution flow while still leveraging LLM capabilities for decision making",
    explain: "LangGraph shines when you need control over your agent's execution, providing predictable behavior through structured workflows.",
    correct: true
  },
]}
/>

### Q3: What role does State play in LangGraph?
Choose the most accurate description of State in LangGraph.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "State is the latest generation from the LLM",
    explain: "State is a user-defined class in LangGraph, not LLM generated. It's fields are user defined, the values can be LLM filled",
  },
  {
    text: "State is only used to track errors during execution",
    explain: "State has a much broader purpose than just error tracking. But that's still usefull.",
  },
  {
    text: "State represents the information that flows through your agent application",
    explain: "State is central to LangGraph and contains all the information needed for decision-making between steps. You provide the fields than you need to compute and the nodes can alter the values to decide on a branching.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "State is only relevant when working with external APIs",
    explain: "State is fundamental to all LangGraph applications, not just those working with external APIs.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q4: What is a Conditional Edge in LangGraph?
Select the most accurate description.

<Question
choices={[
    {
    text: "An edge that determines which node to execute next based on evaluating a condition",
    explain: "Conditional edges allow your graph to make dynamic routing decisions based on the current state, creating branching logic in your workflow.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "An edge that is only followed when a specific condition occurs",
    explain: "Conditional edges control the flow of the application on it's outputs, not on the input.",
  },
  {
    text: "An edge that requires user confirmation before proceeding",
    explain: "Conditional edges are based on programmatic conditions, not user interaction requirements.",
  }
]}
/>

### Q5: How does LangGraph help address the hallucination problem in LLMs?
Choose the best answer.

<Question
choices={[
  {
    text: "LangGraph eliminates hallucinations entirely by limiting LLM responses",
    explain: "No framework can completely eliminate hallucinations from LLMs, LangGraph is no exception.",
  },
  {
    text: "LangGraph provides structured workflows that can validate and verify LLM outputs",
    explain: "By creating structured workflows with validation steps, verification nodes, and error handling paths, LangGraph helps reduce the impact of hallucinations.",
    correct: true
  },
  {
    text: "LangGraph has no effect on hallucinations",
    explain: "LangGraph's structured approach to workflows can help significantly in mitigating hallucinations at the cost of speed.",
  }
]}
/>

Congratulations on completing the quiz! ðŸŽ‰ If you missed any questions, consider reviewing the previous sections to strengthen your understanding. Next, we'll explore more advanced features of LangGraph and see how to build more complex agent workflows.
