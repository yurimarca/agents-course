Starting on Discord can be a bit overwhelming, so here's a quick guide to help you navigate.

<!-- Not the case anymore, you'll be prompted to choose your interests. Be sure to select **"AI Agents"** to gain access to the AI Agents Category, which includes all the course-related channels. Feel free to explore and join additional channels if you wish! ðŸš€-->

The HF Community Server hosts a vibrant community with interests in various areas, offering opportunities for learning through paper discussions, events, and more.

After [signing up](http://hf.co/join/discord), introduce yourself in the `#introduce-yourself` channel.

We created 4 channels for the Agents Course:

- `agents-course-announcements`: for the **latest course informations**.
- `ðŸŽ“-agents-course-general`: for **general discussions and chitchat**.
- `agents-course-questions`: to **ask questions and help your classmates**.
- `agents-course-showcase`: to **show your best agents**.

In addition you can check:

- `smolagents`: for **discussion and support with the library**.
