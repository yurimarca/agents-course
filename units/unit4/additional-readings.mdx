# And now? What topics I should learn?

Agentic AI is a rapidly evolving field, and understanding foundational protocols is essential for building intelligent, autonomous systems. 

Two important standards you should get familiar with are:

- The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
- The **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)**

## üîå Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** by Anthropic is an open standard that enables AI models to securely and seamlessly **connect with external tools, data sources, and applications**, making agents more capable and autonomous.

Think of MCP as a **universal adapter**, like a USB-C port, that allows AI models to plug into various digital environments **without needing custom integration for each one**.

MCP is quickly gaining traction across the industry, with major companies like OpenAI and Google beginning to adopt it.

## ü§ù Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

Google has developed the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** as a complementary counterpart to Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP).

While MCP connects agents to external tools, **A2A connects agents to each other**, paving the way for cooperative, multi-agent systems that can work together to solve complex problems.
