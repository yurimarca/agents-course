Welcome to the final unit of the course! 🎉

So far, you’ve **built a strong foundation in AI Agents**, from understanding their components to creating your own. With this knowledge, you’re now ready to **build powerful agents** and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in this fast-evolving field.

This unit is all about applying what you’ve learned. It’s your **final hands-on project**, and completing it is your ticket to earning the **course certificate**.

## What’s the challenge?

You’ll create your own agent and **evaluate its performance using a subset of the [GAIA benchmark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard)**.

To successfully complete the course, your agent needs to score **30% or higher** on the benchmark. Achieve that, and you’ll earn your **Certificate of Completion**, officially recognizing your expertise. 🏅

Additionally, see how you stack up against your peers! A dedicated **[Student Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Students_leaderboard)** is available for you to submit your scores and see the community's progress.

> ** 🚨 Heads Up: Advanced & Hands-On Unit**
>
> Please be aware that this unit shifts towards a more practical, hands-on approach. Success in this section will require **more advanced coding knowledge** and relies on you navigating tasks with **less explicit guidance** compared to earlier parts of the course.

Sounds exciting? Let’s get started! 🚀
