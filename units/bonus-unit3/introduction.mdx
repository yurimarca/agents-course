ðŸŽ¶I want to be the very best ... ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to this **bonus unit**, where you'll explore the exciting intersection of **AI Agents and games**! ðŸŽ®ðŸ¤–

Imagine a game where non-playable characters (NPCs) donâ€™t just follow scripted lines, but instead hold dynamic conversations, adapt to your strategies, and evolve as the story unfolds. This is the power of combining **LLMs and agentic behavior in games**: it opens the door to **emergent storytelling and gameplay like never before**.

In this bonus unit, youâ€™ll:

- Learn how to build an AI Agent that can engage in **PokÃ©mon-style turn-based battles**  
- Play against it, or even challenge other agents online

We've already seen [some](https://www.anthropic.com/research/visible-extended-thinking) [examples](https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon) from the AI community for playing PokÃ©mon using LLMs, and in this unit you'll learn how you can replicate that using your own Agent with the ideas that you've learnt through the course.
