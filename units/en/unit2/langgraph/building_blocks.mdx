# Building Blocks of LangGraph

To build applications with LangGraph, you need to understand its core components. Let's explore the fundamental building blocks that make up a LangGraph application.

An application in LangGraph starts from an **entrypoint**, and depending on the execution, the flow may go to one function or another until it reaches the END.

## 1. State

**State** is the central concept in LangGraph. It represents all the information that flows through your application. 

```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    graph_state: str
```

The state is **User defined**, hence the fields should carefully be crafted to contain all data needed for decision-making process!

> 💡 **Tip:** Think carefully about what information your application needs to track between steps.

## 2. Nodes

**Nodes** are python functions. Each node:
- Takes the state as input
- Performs some operation
- Returns updates to the state

```python
def node_1(state):
    print("---Node 1---")
    return {"graph_state": state['graph_state'] +" I am"}

def node_2(state):
    print("---Node 2---")
    return {"graph_state": state['graph_state'] +" happy!"}

def node_3(state):
    print("---Node 3---")
    return {"graph_state": state['graph_state'] +" sad!"}
```

For example, Nodes can contain:
- **LLM calls**: Generate text or make decisions
- **Tool calls**: Interact with external systems
- **Conditional logic**: Determine next steps
- **Human intervention**: Get input from users

> 💡 **Info:** Some nodes necessary for the whole workflow like START and END exist from langGraph directly. 


## 3. Edges

**Edges** connect nodes and define the possible paths through your graph:

```python
import random
from typing import Literal

def decide_mood(state) -> Literal["node_2", "node_3"]:
    
    # Often, we will use state to decide on the next node to visit
    user_input = state['graph_state'] 
    
    # Here, let's just do a 50 / 50 split between nodes 2, 3
    if random.random() < 0.5:

        # 50% of the time, we return Node 2
        return "node_2"
    
    # 50% of the time, we return Node 3
    return "node_3"
```

Edges can be:
- **Direct**: Always go from node A to node B
- **Conditional**: Choose the next node based on the current state

## 4. StateGraph

The **StateGraph** is the container that holds your entire agent workflow:

```python
from IPython.display import Image, display
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

# Build graph
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", node_2)
builder.add_node("node_3", node_3)

# Logic
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_conditional_edges("node_1", decide_mood)
builder.add_edge("node_2", END)
builder.add_edge("node_3", END)

# Add
graph = builder.compile()
```

Which can then be visualized! 
```python
# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

But most importantly, invoked:
```python
graph.invoke({"graph_state" : "Hi, this is Lance."})
```
output :
```
---Node 1---
---Node 3---
{'graph_state': 'Hi, this is Lance. I am sad!'}
```

## What's Next?

In the next section, we'll put these concepts into practice by building our first graph. This graph lets Alfred take in your e-mails, classify them, and craft a preliminary answer if they are genuine.
