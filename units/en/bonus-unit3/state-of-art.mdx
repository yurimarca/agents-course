# The State of the Art in Using LLMs in Games

To give you a sense on how much progress has been made in this field, let’s examine three tech demos and one published game that showcase the integration of LLMs in gaming.

Unveiled at GDC 2024, *Covert Protocol* is a tech demo that places you in the shoes of a private detective. 

What’s interesting in this demo is the the use of AI-powered NPCs that respond to your inquiries in real-time, influencing the narrative based on your interactions. 

The demo is built on Unreal Engine 5, it leverages NVIDIA's Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) and Inworld's AI to create lifelike character interactions.

Also at GDC 2024, Ubisoft introduced *NEO NPCs*, a prototype showcasing NPCs powered by generative AI. 

These characters can perceive their environment, remember past interactions, and engage in meaningful conversations with players. 

The idea here is to create more immersive and responsive game worlds where the player can have true interaction with NPCs.

After exploring these demos, you might be wondering: "These examples showcase the use of LLMs in games  but they don't seem to involve Agents. So, what's the distinction, and what additional capabilities do Agents bring to the table?” 

Don’t worry, it’s what we’re going to study in the next section.
