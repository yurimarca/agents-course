Now that you have all the details, let's get started! We're going to do four things:

1. **Create your Hugging Face Account** if it's not already done
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don't be shy 🤗)
3. **Follow the Hugging Face Agents Course** on the Hub
4. **Spread the word** about the course

### Step 1: Create Your Hugging Face Account

(If you haven't already) create a Hugging Face account <a href='https://huggingface.co/join' target='_blank'>here</a>.

### Step 2: Join Our Discord Community

👉🏻 Join our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/UrrTSsSyjb" target="_blank">here.</a>

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in `#introduce-yourself`.

We have multiple AI Agent-related channels:
- `agents-course-announcements`: for the **latest course information**.
- `🎓-agents-course-general`: for **general discussions and chitchat**.
- `agents-course-questions`: to **ask questions and help your classmates**.
- `agents-course-showcase`: to **show your best agents**.

In addition you can check:

- `smolagents`: for **discussion and support with the library**.

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check [the next section](discord101).

### Step 3: Follow the Hugging Face Agent Course Organization

Stay up to date with the latest course materials, updates, and announcements **by following the Hugging Face Agents Course Organization**.

👉 Go <a href="https://huggingface.co/agents-course" target="_blank">here</a> and click on **follow**.

### Step 4: Spread the word about the course

Help us make this course more visible! There are two way you can help us:

1. Show your support by ⭐ <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/agents-course" target="_blank">the course's repository</a>.

### Step 5: Running Models Locally with Ollama (In case you run into Credit limits)

1. **Install Ollama**

    Follow the official Instructions <a href="https://ollama.com/download" target="_blank"> here.</a>

2. **Pull a model Locally**
``` bash
    ollama pull qwen2:7b #Check out ollama website for more models
```
3. **Start Ollama in the background (In one terminal)**
``` bash
    ollama serve
``` 
4. **Use `LiteLLMModel` Instead of `HfApiModel`**
``` bash
    from smolagents import LiteLLMModel

    model = LiteLLMModel(
        model_id="ollama_chat/qwen2.5:7b",  # Or try other Ollama-supported models
        api_base="http://127.0.0.1:11434",  # Default Ollama local server
        num_ctx=8192,
    )
```

5. **Why this works?**
- Ollama serves models locally using an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:11434`.
- `LiteLLMModel` is built to communicate with any model that supports the OpenAI chat/completion API format.
- This means you can simply swap out `HfApiModel` for `LiteLLMModel` no other code changes required. It’s a seamless, plug-and-play solution.

Congratulations! 🎉 **You've completed the onboarding process**! You're now ready to start learning about AI Agents. Have fun!

Keep Learning, stay awesome 🤗
