# Quick Self-Check (ungraded) [[quiz2]] 


What?! Another Quiz? We know, we know, ... ðŸ˜… But this short, ungraded quiz is here to **help you reinforce key concepts you've just learned**.

This quiz covers Large Language Models (LLMs), message systems, and tools; essential components for understanding and building AI agents.

### Q1: Which of the following best describes an AI tool?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "A process that only generates text responses",
explain: "",
},
{
text: "An executable process or external API that allows agents to perform specific tasks and interact with external environments",
explain: "Tools are executable functions that agents can use to perform specific tasks and interact with external environments.",
correct: true
},
{
text: "A feature that stores agent conversations",
explain: "",
}
]}
/>

### Q2: How do AI agents use tools as a form of "acting" in an environment?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "By passively waiting for user instructions",
explain: "",
},
{
text: "By only using pre-programmed responses",
explain: "",
},
{
text: "By asking the LLM to generate tool invocation code when appropriate and running tools on behalf of the model",
explain: "Agents can invoke tools and use reasoning to plan and re-plan based on the information gained.",
correct: true
}
]}
/>

### Q3: What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "A simple chatbot designed to respond with pre-defined answers",
explain: "",
},
{
text: "A deep learning model trained on large amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language",
explain: "",
correct: true
},
{
text: "A rule-based AI that follows strict predefined commands",
explain: "",
}
]}
/>

### Q4: Which of the following best describes the role of special tokens in LLMs?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "They are additional words stored in the model's vocabulary to enhance text generation quality",
explain: "",
},
{
text: "They serve specific functions like marking the end of a sequence (EOS) or separating different message roles in chat models",
explain: "",
correct: true
},
{
text: "They are randomly inserted tokens used to improve response variability",
explain: "",
}
]}
/>

### Q5: How do AI chat models process user messages internally?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "They directly interpret messages as structured commands with no transformations",
explain: "",
},
{
text: "They convert user messages into a formatted prompt by concatenating system, user, and assistant messages",
explain: "",
correct: true
},
{
text: "They generate responses randomly based on previous conversations",
explain: "",
}
]}
/>
