### Q1: What is an Agent?
Which of the following best describes an AI Agent?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "An AI model that can reason, plan, and use tools to interact with its environment to achieve a specific goal.",
explain: "This definition captures the essential characteristics of an Agent.",
correct: true
},
{
text: "A system that solely processes static text, without any inherent mechanism to interact dynamically with its surroundings or execute meaningful actions.",
explain: "An Agent must be able to take an action and interact with its environment.",
},
{
text: "A conversational agent restricted to answering queries, lacking the ability to perform any actions or interact with external systems.",
explain: "A chatbot like this lacks the ability to take actions, making it different from an Agent.",
},
{
text: "An online repository of information that offers static content without the capability to execute tasks or interact actively with users.",
explain: "An Agent actively interacts with its environment rather than just providing static information.",
}
]}
/>

### Q2: What is the Role of Planning in an Agent?
Why does an Agent need to plan before taking an action?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "To primarily store or recall past interactions, rather than mapping out a sequence of future actions.",
explain: "Planning is about determining future actions, not storing past interactions.",
},
{
text: "To decide on the sequence of actions and select appropriate tools needed to fulfill the userâ€™s request.",
explain: "Planning helps the Agent determine the best steps and tools to complete a task.",
correct: true
},
{
text: "To execute a sequence of arbitrary and uncoordinated actions that lack any defined strategy or intentional objective.",
explain: "Planning ensures the Agent's actions are intentional and not random.",
},
{
text: "To merely convert or translate text, bypassing any process of formulating a deliberate sequence of actions or employing strategic reasoning.",
explain: "Planning is about structuring actions, not just converting text.",
}
]}
/>

### Q3: How Do Tools Enhance an Agent's Capabilities?
Why are tools essential for an Agent?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "Tools serve no real purpose and do not contribute to the Agentâ€™s ability to perform actions beyond basic text generation.",
explain: "Tools expand an Agent's capabilities by allowing it to perform actions beyond text generation.",
},
{
text: "Tools are solely designed for memory storage, lacking any capacity to facilitate the execution of tasks or enhance interactive performance.",
explain: "Tools are primarily for performing actions, not just for storing data.",
},
{
text: "Tools severely restrict the Agent exclusively to generating text, thereby preventing it from engaging in a broader range of interactive actions.",
explain: "On the contrary, tools allow Agents to go beyond text-based responses.",
},
{
text: "Tools provide the Agent with the ability to execute actions a text-generation model cannot perform natively, such as making coffee or generating images.",
explain: "Tools enable Agents to interact with the real world and complete tasks.",
correct: true
}
]}
/>

### Q4: How Do Actions Differ from Tools?
What is the key difference between Actions and Tools?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "Actions are the steps the Agent takes, while Tools are external resources the Agent can use to perform those actions.",
explain: "Actions are higher-level objectives, while Tools are specific functions the Agent can call upon.",
correct: true
},
{
text: "Actions and Tools are entirely identical components that can be used interchangeably, with no clear differences between them.",
explain: "No, Actions are goals or tasks, while Tools are specific utilities the Agent uses to achieve them.",
},
{
text: "Tools are considered broad utilities available for various functions, whereas Actions are mistakenly thought to be restricted only to physical interactions.",
explain: "Not necessarily. Actions can involve both digital and physical tasks.",
},
{
text: "Actions inherently require the use of LLMs to be determined and executed, whereas Tools are designed to function autonomously without such dependencies.",
explain: "While LLMs help decide Actions, Actions themselves are not dependent on LLMs.",
}
]}
/>

### Q5: What Role Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Play in Agents?
How do LLMs contribute to an Agentâ€™s functionality?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "LLMs function merely as passive repositories that store information, lacking any capability to actively process input or produce dynamic responses.",
explain: "LLMs actively process text input and generate responses, rather than just storing information.",
},
{
text: "LLMs serve as the reasoning 'brain' of the Agent, processing text inputs to understand instructions and plan actions.",
explain: "LLMs enable the Agent to interpret, plan, and decide on the next steps.",
correct: true
},
{
text: "LLMs are erroneously believed to be used solely for image processing, when in fact their primary function is to process and generate text.",
explain: "LLMs primarily work with text, although they can sometimes interact with multimodal inputs.",
},
{
text: "LLMs are considered completely irrelevant to the operation of AI Agents, implying that they are entirely superfluous in any practical application.",
explain: "LLMs are a core component of modern AI Agents.",
}
]}
/>

### Q6: Which of the Following Best Demonstrates an AI Agent?
Which real-world example best illustrates an AI Agent at work?

<Question
choices={[
{
text: "A static FAQ page on a website that provides fixed information and lacks any interactive or dynamic response capabilities.",
explain: "A static FAQ page does not interact dynamically with users or take actions.",
},
{
text: "A simple calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on fixed rules, without any capability for reasoning or planning.",
explain: "A calculator follows fixed rules without reasoning or planning, so it is not an Agent.",
},
{
text: "A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa that can understand spoken commands, reason through them, and perform tasks like setting reminders or sending messages.",
explain: "This example includes reasoning, planning, and interaction with the environment.",
correct: true
},
{
text: "A video game NPC that operates on a fixed script of responses, without the ability to reason, plan, or use external tools.",
explain: "Unless the NPC can reason, plan, and use tools, it does not function as an AI Agent.",
}
]}
